# RUST

Today i started learning rust and this repo contains the beginner guide.

## How much i have learned ðŸ¤”

I have learned how to install rust on my system and create new rust project accordingly.

1) We can create a new rust project by running: `cargo new`.
2) We can then build that project by running: `cargo build`.
3) We can then run that project by running: `cargo run`.
4) We can then check for errors by running: `cargo check`.

**An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system youâ€™re working on. So, at this point, weâ€™ll no longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.**

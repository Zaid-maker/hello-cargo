# RUST

Today i started learning rust and this repo contains the beginner guide.

## How much i have learned ðŸ¤”

I have learned how to install rust on my system and create new rust project accordingly.

1) We can create a new rust project by running: `cargo new`.
2) We can then build that project by running: `cargo build`.
3) We can then run that project by running: `cargo run`.
4) We can then check for errors by running: `cargo check`.

**An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no matter which operating system youâ€™re working on. So, at this point, weâ€™ll no longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.**

## Building for release

When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in target/release instead of target/debug. The optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final program youâ€™ll give to a user that wonâ€™t be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If youâ€™re benchmarking your codeâ€™s running time, be sure to run `cargo build --release` and benchmark with the executable in target/release.
